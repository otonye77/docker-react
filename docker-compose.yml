# version: This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version '3' supports Docker 1.13.0 and above.
# services: Defines the services (containers) to be created.
# web: This is the name of the service.
# build:
# context: Specifies the build context (i.e., the path to the build directory). Here, itâ€™s the current directory (.).
# dockerfile: Points to a specific Dockerfile to use, named Dockerfile.dev.
# ports: Maps the host's port to the container's port. Here, port 3000 on the host is mapped to port 3000 on the container, which is typical for a web application like a Node.js app.
# volumes: Mounts host paths or named volumes into the container.
# /app/node_modules: Ensures that the node_modules directory from the container is used, and it is not overwritten by the mount from the host.
# .: /app: Maps the current directory (.) on the host to /app inside the container. This allows for live code reloading by synchronizing the files between the host and the container.
